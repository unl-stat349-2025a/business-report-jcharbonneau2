# Summary

Prompted by a recent viewing of *Sharknado (2013)*, the concerns within
leadership have risen about the potential for aquatic life to be picked
up and deposited inland. This would lead to chaos on ecosystems and make
storms that hold even more danger than is already present.

This report offers a data-driven assessment of the so-called "sharknado"
threat, using data sets from:

-   **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)** - for
    tornado tracking and storm events
-   **United States Geological Survey (USGS)** and **NOAA shark
    monitoring stations** - for marine life locations

**Key findings include:**

-   **Tornado Strength Estimates**: Due to a missing EF-scale in many of
    the records, storm *duration* was use to estimate the strength of
    the storms - specifically identifying waterspouts that lasted more
    than twenty minutes.
-   It is even rarer for these tornadoes to originate directly over
    known shark habitats.
-   **Likelihood Analysis**: Based on frequency, location, and proximity
    to sharks, the probability of a "sharknado" event is effectively
    zero - calculated at approximately **2.5 × 10⁻9**.

**Recommendations**

-   No operational changes are required at this time based on
    thisscenario.

-   Communication teams may choose to address the topic preemptively -
    especially if it resurfaces in public media.

-   Climate change adaptation efforts should continue to focus on
    high-likelihood, high-impact scenarios (flooding, hurricane surges,
    etc.)

**Conclusion**

While the idea of airborne sharks is a cinematic fantasy, the analysis
confirms that the real-world risk of such events is negligible. The rare
alignment of location, storm strength, and shark presence makes
a"sharknado" event effectively impossible.

Company operations face **no measurable risk** from shark-laden storms.

Resources should be directed towards tangible climate resilience
strategies.

# Introduction

Following a recent viewing of Sharknado (2013), concerns from management
have been raised about the possibility of coastal tornadoes that form in
shark-infested waters carrying said sharks onto the mainland. While the
story of the film relies heavily on science fiction tropes, the
continuously increasing concern on the effect that climate change will
have on storms such as tornadoes is a question that remains pressing.
This growing intensity especially concerns those living in areas near
the coastlines.

In light of these stated concerns, this report investigates the
plausibility for such extreme events. Recent works, such as studies
performed by M.J. Woods [@Woods2023] points to a measurable increase in
tornado intensity as a result of climate change and shifts in
atmospheric stability. With global temperatures rising, the dynamics of
energy in weather systems are also varying, resulting in more extreme
and erratic tornadoes.

Drawing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), this report will analyze the possibility of tornadoes of high
strengths that have the potential of carrying objects moving from the
coast to land. Though the idea of a tornado carrying a shark is
generally implausible, the underlying issue of storm intensity
increasing is demanding of attention. The findings in this report aim to
inform about the intensity of tornadoes and to provide insight for
business continuity plans in the face of such extreme circumstances.

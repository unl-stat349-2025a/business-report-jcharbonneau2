# Methods

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis draws from two primary sources:

-   **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):** Tornado and storm event data were filtered out to only include data from 2020 to 2024. This data was combined and collected into a single data set. The important data set attributes include:
    -   Storm type (filtered out to only include Waterspouts)
    -   Start/End coordinates
    -   Duration of storm
-   **National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS):** Shark monitoring station data including latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for underwater stations. This data enabled spatial comparison between tornado paths and documented shark habits.

These two data sets were cleaned and merged to support proximity and overlap analyses.

## Geographic & Temporal Filtering

In order to isolate tornado events that had relevance to the "sharknado" threat:

-   Only tornadoes classified as **Waterspouts** were retained, as they formed over the shark-infested waters.

-   Due to many entries lacking an EF-scale value, storm duration was used as a proxy for tornado strength.

    -   Waterspouts lasting **longer than 20 minutes** were considered to be more likely to be strong enough to transport marine life.

-   The data set was further filtered to exclusively include tornadoes within the boundaries of the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean with their respective coordinates.

These filters prioritized tornadoes with plausible strength and proximity to shark-populated waters that also had the potential to move inland.

## Shark Station Cleaning and Integration

The NMFS shark data set was prepared through:

-   Renaming and selecting relevant coordinate fields (pertaining to the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean)

-   Removing records with missing/invalid geographic data

With this filtering, consistent spatial framework for overlap analysis was ensured.

## Waterspout Proximity Analysis

To assess potential overlap between tornadoes and shark-prone regions, all geographic coordinates were converted into an Albers Equal Area (AEA) projection. This projection preserves area and is well-suited for regional distance analysis in the United States.

Using this projection, the proximity of each storm (waterspout) to documented shark locations was calculated. A 50 kilometer threshold was used to flag tornadoes occurring within close range of any shark stations, and these points were retained for further analysis.

This spatial approach ensured accurate measurement over coastal geography and improved reliability when estimated how often stronger, longer-duration waterspouts occur in shark-populated waters.

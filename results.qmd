## Spatial Overlap of Waterspouts and Shark Zones

In order to more closely examine potential interactions between
tornadoes and shark infested waters, a spatial overlap analysis was
conducted. This analysis used the **ggplot2**, **mapdata**, **maps**,
and **sf** libraries.

The shark stations included were along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic
Coast, with a significant amount along the Florida Peninsula, as seen in
Figure @ref(fig:shark-station).

#| label: "shark-station"
#| fig-cap: "Shark Station Locations"
#| out-width: 150%
#| echo: false 

knitr::include_graphics('shark_station_locations.png')

```

Then, an analysis was conducted to survey the overlap between the strong
waterspouts and the shark station locations. With the AEA projection, a
50 km threshold was applied. The waterspout-location overlap can be seen
in @ref(station_storm_overlap).

## Inland Tornado Movement

With the filtered data, which included over 6,000 tornado events, only
sixteen were classified as waterspouts that both met the duration
requirement and occurred within 50 kilometers of a major U.S. coastline
(Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean, or Pacific Ocean). These events were
concentration primarily along the Florida Peninsula or Gulf Coast. Due
to the missing/incomplete EF-scale ratings in these records, their
strength was unable to be determined. However, the scarcity of
qualifying storms suggests that inland movement of waterspouts from
shark-dense waters is highly uncommon.

## Estimated Probability of Shark Transportation

To assess the theoretical likelihood of a "sharknado" scenario, the
joint probability of three independent conditions being met is assumed:

1.  A tornado forms over shark-monitored waters: P(Shark Location)

2.  The tornado is classified as a waterspout: P(Waterspout)

3.  The tornado travels inland with sufficient duration: P(Inland)

Using the observed frequencies from the cleaned NOAA dataset and shark
monitoring data, the following probability was calculated as:

$$
P(\text{Sharknado}) = P(\text{Waterspout}) \times
P(\text{Inland}) \times P(\text{Shark Location}) \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}
$$

This extremely low probability, nearing zero, supports the conclusion that the likelihood of a tornado forming over shark-infesting waters containing the strength to move and deposit sharks inland is **negligibly small**.

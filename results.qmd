## Spatial Overlap of Waterspouts and Shark Zones

To explore potential interactions between tornadoes and shark-infested waters, a detailed spatial overlap analysis was performed. This analysis aimed to understand whether tornado paths, specifically waterspouts, intersect with areas known for shark populations. The libraries used for this analysis were **ggplot2**, **mapdata**, **maps**, and **sf**, allowing for efficient mapping and spatial analysis. 

After the filtering, the shark stations included in the analysis were located along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Cost, with a significant concentration along the Florida Peninsula. These stations monitor shark activity in the area and represent regions where there is a higher likelihood of encountering sharks. Figure 4.1 displays a map providing a clear visual representation of these stations.

Following this, an analysis determined the spatial overlap between the locations of strong waterspouts and shark locations. To achieve this, the spatial data was projected using the Albers Equal Area (AEA) projection, which is a projection commonly used for maps involving large areas like coastlines. The overlap of waterspouts and shark zones can be seen in figure 4.2, where the regions of significant overlap are highlighted in red.

## Inland Tornado Movement

The next step in the analysis focused on tornadoes that may have the potential to move from the inland to the coast. From over 6,000 tornado events in the NOAA dataset, only sixteen were classified as waterspouts that both met the duration requirement and occurred within 50 kilometers of major U.S. coastlines. 

Due to missing or incomplete EF-scale ratings for many of the events, it was not possible to get a true reading of their strength. However, the fact that only sixteen waterspouts met the duration of over twenty minutes and also met the proximity requirements, it can be inferred that waterspouts from shark-dense coastal waters is an extremely rare occurrence. This rarity indicates that the movement of such tornadoes beyond the coast, along with their potential for carrying sharks inland, is not a typical event and is unlikely to occur. 

## Estimated Probability of Shark Transportation

To assess the theoretical likelihood of a "sharknado" scenario, the
joint probability of three independent conditions being met is assumed:

1.  A tornado forms over shark-monitored waters: P(Shark Location)

2.  The tornado is classified as a waterspout: P(Waterspout)

3.  The tornado travels inland with sufficient duration: P(Inland)

Using the observed frequencies from the cleaned NOAA dataset and shark
monitoring data, the following probability was calculated as:

$$
P(\text{Sharknado}) = P(\text{Waterspout}) \times
P(\text{Inland}) \times P(\text{Shark Location}) \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}
$$

This calculation yields an extremely low probability, effectively zero for practical purposes. Such a low probability supports the conclusion that the likelihood of a tornado forming over shark-infested waters, carrying sharks, and moving inland is **negligibly small**.
